<dt>Skill</dt>
<dd>If this player's type is "Computer," this option sets the skill level of the computer's Artificial Intelligence.
(Don't be disappointed if you cannot beat the computer at the hardest setting&#8212;it's impossible!)</dd>
<dt>Animation Speed</dt>

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>Black is the first player to take a turn.</p>
<p>The very first turn consists of only one move.  Player 1 (black) gets to place a stone anywhere on the board.</p>
<p>For the next turn, Player 2 (white) gets to place 2 stones on the board.  If Player 2
completes a pair of symbols, he/she can remove Player 1's stone from the board.</p>
<p>All subsequent turns are like Player 2's first turn and follow this pattern:</p>
<ol>
<li>The current player places a stone on the board.</li>
<li>If the symbol on the board position just played matches a symbol under any of the current player's other stones,
he/she must immediately remove a stone from the other player.</li>
<li>The current player places a second stone on the board.</li>
<li>If the current player completes a second pair of symbols, he/she removes another stone from the other player.</li>
</ol>
<p>The game ends when either:</p>
<ul>
<li>A player completes an entire row, column, or diagonal with 4 stones.</li>
<li>It is impossible for the current player to move (a tie).</li>
</ul>
